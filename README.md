# Platform Bomber

Platform Bomber is a 3D hyper-casual game, where you jump from one platform to another to reach the end. 
Make you bomb bigger and go with a bang.

## How to play

Touch the screen to make your bomb bigger. When you let go of the screen, the bomb will explode and send you flying towards the next platform. The more you hold your finger the further you will fly.
- If you can't land on a platform and fall, the game ends.
- If you land right on the middle of the platform you will get a perfect and gain extra points.
- If you score a perfect for 4 times in a row, you will fly further further than before and gain more points.
- When you reach the last platform, you will go on to the next level where you have a higher multiplier.

## Notes

- Platform Bomber is a game made using Unity Game Engine.
- It uses new shader graph in unity to create the fog effect.
- It uses tweening to make everything smoother.
